	<h1>For a few Billion</h1>
	<p>There is an old tale about a king who offered a servant $10,000 as a reward. The servant instead asked that for 30 days he be given an amount that would double, starting with a penny. (1 penny for the first day, 2 for the second, 4 for the third, then 8, 16, 32 pennies, and so on).</p>

	<p>Use for loops to answer the following:</p>

	<p>How much was the reward after 30 days?
	remember, a penny isn't 1, but 0.01 </p>

	<script>
		var dayCount = 0;
		for(var value = 0.01; value <=10000 ; value = value*2)
		{
			console.log("Now you have $" + value + " on day " + dayCount);
			dayCount++;
		}
		console.log("It takes " + dayCount + " days to close to $10,000");
	</script>
